    "### Introduction and motivation\n",
    "In modern dosimetry, the gold standard of radiation dose measurement is _effective dose_. This quantity is defined as a sum over dose to each major organ in the human body, weighted by a set of _tissue weighting factors_ that encode the average risk to health of a dose to that organ. This is a complex and difficult measurement to make, as many modern dosimeters are either optimised for field direction measurement or a fluence measurement. For example, for a Bonner sphere spectrometer, measuring effective dose is a time-consuming and computationally intensive process that requires careful measurement of the radiation field with varying size of polyethylene sphere and a complex unfolding algorithm to reconstruct the fluence, and this still lacks directional information about the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the segmentation of nFacet 3D encodes both the direction and the energy of an incident neutron field. This can be visualised through the direction and intensity of attenuation of neutron count in the detector cubes. There are therefore two components to measuring the effective dose: reconstructing the fluence of the incident neutron field, and the direction of incidence of the neutrons. Here an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for fluence reconstrunction, as once trained this is a fast method for reconstructing the fluence without need for a complex unfolding algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training inputs\n",
    "The neutron fluence is encoded in the distribution of counts across cubes in the detector, and as a result these counts are a natural choice for the neural network inputs. The data used for training the network was generated using a Geant4 simulation of the nFacet detector with the detector inside a Geant4 model of the low scattering facility at NPL. The geometry of this setup can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAKE SCHEMATICS (x-y, y-z)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutron spectrum of the source is specified at runtime, and each generated neutron is tracked until capture or reaching zero energy. The simulated detector registers counts for neutron capture on $^{6}$LiF:ZnS(Ag) and on PVT, and these two cases can be distinguished based on the particles remaining at the end of the track of a given neutron. The cube each hit occurs in is registered and saved, and individual neutrons can be grouped by the ID of the cube they capture in. \n",
    "\n",
    "A unique ID number is assigned to each cube and the cube-level counts are flattened into a 1D array for input into the neural network. As the counts are normalised to sum to 1, the input given to the network is the fraction of counts in each cube.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also additional information encoded in the bulk response of the detector to an applied neutron field. By summing the counts in planes  of cubes across the detector, we obtain 4 bins for each coordinate axis (X, Y and Z) which encode the attenuation length of the applied field in each of these directions. This can be appended to the cube-counts to produce a 76-length array as an input to the network. Each set of planes is normalised to 1 so that there is equal weighting between the cube counts and each set of plane counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in [**put link to real vs sim here]**, there is good agreement between the results of the simulation and real-world data. As a result we use simulated data for training the neural network model, as it is easier and  much cheaper to obtain than real datasets, whilst still describing the real situation well. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we assume a 3% uncertainty on the fractional counts in each cube or plane. This corresponds to a real measurement of approximately 64,000 neutrons which in turn gives an average of 1000 neutrons per detector cube, which results in a 3% Poisson error. By the central limit theorem, this is equivalent to a 3% Gaussian error as  This is well motivated as this is size of dataset can be taken in ~10s of minutes at a source neutron rate of ~100 Hz, depending on the energy of the source. To augment the training dataset we take statistical resamples of each unique training data point, assuming the same 3% Gaussian uncertainty. This allows the network to learn the true distribution of cube counts for a given source, rather than learning the noise in the initial data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training targets\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to reconstruct the fluence of the applied neutron field. In order to do this, the targets are taken to be a binned representation of the true fluence of each source. The specific energy binning scheme depends on the energy resolution of the detector, and we determine appropriate bin boundaries by looking for sources that the detector has sufficient resolution to distinguish. We calculate the absolute percentage difference of count in each cube between the two sources of interest, and any cubes with a difference greater than 3$\\sigma$ are deemed statistically distinguishable. We require that at least 75% of the cube counts are distinguishable in this way for two sources to be distinguishable. An example comparison of this kind is shown in Figure {NUMBER}.\n",

    "\n",
    "The information for the network to learn is encoded in the distribution of neutron count across cubes in the detector. As a result, the first choice of input into the network consisted of 64 input neurons corresponding to the 64 cubes of the detector, whilst the output of the ANN was the binned fluence of the source in a total of 8 bins. The architecture of this model can be seen in Figure 1. When looking at various neural network models, we give them labels of the form \"nnI_L1_L2_L3_..._O\", where I denotes the number of input neurons, L*i* denotes the number of neurons in hidden layer *i*, and O denotes the number of output neurons. The model discussed here is labelled as nn64_128_64_32_8. \n",

There are 64 input neurons corresponding to the 64 cubes of the detector, three hidden layers with ReLU activations, and 8 output neurons. In this diagram each node actually corresponds to 8 neurons, where all neurons are fully connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, summing the counts in planes of cubes provides additional information about the bulk response of the detector to the applied field and thus encodes more detailed information about the energy of the incident neutrons. This can be added to the inputs, adding 12 additional neurons corresponding to the four planes in the x, y and z directions. The number of neurons in hidden layers is also increased to fit the new data. We identify this model with the label nn76_152_76_38_8. \n",

    "### Analysis of error\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the effectiveness of the neural network, we must find the error on the effective dose predicted by the model, as this is the quantity of interest for this problem. As the model predicts a coarsely binned fluence, there is error not only from the model itself but also from the binning procedure when the continuous fluence of the source is coarsified into the energy bins used for the neural network targets. The dose conversion coefficients may vary significantly across the width of the bin but from the binned fluence the best estimate of the dose we can make is from the average dose coefficient in the bin, which can result in a significant error in the dose just from coarsifying the fluence. For dose calculations, the AP direction dose coefficients were used. For reference, here is the AP dose curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "![AP dose curve](Plots/reference_AP_dose_curve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the dose from a binned fluence, the exact energies of the neutrons are not known and so instead dose must be calculated from an average dose per fluence for each bin. This average dose per fluence in each bin is found by integrating the dose coefficient curve over each bin and dividing by the bin width. Then, the total binned dose per fluence for each source is found by multiplying the counts in each bin for that source by the binned dose coefficients, and summing these products. This can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{binned} = \\sum_i c_i \\frac{\\int_i D(E) dE}{\\Delta E_i}, $$\n",
    "where c_i denotes the count in bin *i*, D(E) denotes the dose coefficients as a function of energy, and $\\Delta E_i$ denotes the width in energy of bin *i*. For dose per fluence, these counts $c_i$ should be normalised such that $\\sum_i c_i = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The true dose per fluence is found by integrating the product of the dose curve and the source distribution over the total energy range, given as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{true} = \\int_0^\\infty f(E) D(E) dE, $$\n",
    "where f(E) is the true source distribution as a function of energy. This distribution is normalised such that $\\int_0^\\infty f(E) dE = 1.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the relative dose per fluence error is expressed as $\\frac{D_{binned} - D_{true}}{D_{true}}$. This relative error resulting from the binning is shown in the table below.\n",

    "Prediction on the test data is approximately equivalently bad for all of these models. All models seem to have learned to predict significant values in at most 2 or 3 bins, likely as the vase majority of the sources used for training only have counts in at most 3 bins. A way of tackling this would be to augment the training dataset with sources that are continuous across more bins than the existing data points, which could be accomplished in several ways:\n",

    "* Generating additional training data with a greater spread in energy (e.g. larger Gaussian spread), such that individual data points cover more energy bins\n",
    "* Implementing a transform to produce new data points composed of a linear combination of two or more existing data points\n",
    "* Training on 1 or 2 of the test sources, to see if that improves prediction on the third (and on more complex sources in general) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the first approach is straightforward, it will add data points that peak around a particular bin and have a spread around that bin, rather than producing a more complex neutron spectrum that may have multiple peaks, although more complex distributions than a Gaussian could be used. It also would require generating a significant amount of additional training data, which is not storage efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach can in principle can teach the model more flexibility in how sources with a wide range of energies are encoded in the counts measured by the detector. This transformation would allow the model to learn an how an arbitrary fluence is encoded in the inputs, but in order to result in good prediction on real sources it may require some more careful logic on which sources are combined by the transformation, e.g. only taking those close in energy. However, following implementation of a rotation transform it may be informative to provide training data that is a composite of a high energy source on one side of the detector with a thermal source on the opposite side, to emulate a scenario with backscattered thermal neutrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the final approach eventually the model will be trained on all of these sources, but in the mean time training on one of these may be useful to test the ability of the model to learn a more continuous source on top of the monoenergetic sources it is already learning.\n",

In order to prevent this, I propose adding a term to the loss that penalises any bins with a negative value in the output. This could for example be done with a simple boolean check on each value in the output tensor, adding a factor *k* to the loss for each bin that has a negative value. This factor *k* could be tuned at initialisation of the loss function in order to tune how harshly the model penalises negative bins, and the ideal value of this parameter can be investigated."

    "There are a few points of note from these results:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In general, the error from the binning procedure is higher for the monoenergetic sources than the continuous sources. This is because the dose contribution from a given bin for a continuous source will be from a range of energies across that bin as opposed to from a single energy within the bin. As a result the continuous distribution across the bin effectively averages out the dose more than the monoenergetic source, thus meaning that the average dose coefficient used to calculate the binned dose is a closer match to the true dose.\n",
    " - The relative error between the predicted dose and the true dose decreases as a function of energy for the models with only cubes included, whilst for the models including profiles it underestimates the error more at higher energies. This can be seen in more detail in the plot below.\n",
