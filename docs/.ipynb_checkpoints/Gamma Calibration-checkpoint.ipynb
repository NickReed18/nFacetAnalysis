However, peak broadening effects in the detector distort these distributions, resulting in the shape seen in this plot. For this analysis, we focus on the distribution from the first photopeak of Co$^{60}$ at 1173.2 keV, with a Compton edge energy of 963.3 keV. The broadening effects give rise to a non-trivial distribution, but here it is approximated by a half-Gaussian function from the peak of the distribution onwards. The ADC value of this Compton edge can be extracted from the value of ADC at the 1$\\sigma$ width of the distribution. "
