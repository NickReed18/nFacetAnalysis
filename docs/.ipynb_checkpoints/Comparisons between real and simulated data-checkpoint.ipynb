This data was then compared with real data taken at NPL, with known incident fluence, to ensure that the simulated efficiency is consistent with a real efficiency. \n",

However, the comparison of $F_C$/$F_A$ for 144 keV and 1.2 MeV reveals an energy-dependent discrepancy between the two; by considering just the 1.5 m case, the fraction of acceptance $F_A$ is constant and therefore this discrepancy must lie in the fraction of generated count that is incident on the detector, $F_C$.

However, we now discover some peculiar dips in the capture efficiency, centred around ~425 keV and ~1 MeV. Additional energies have been sampled around these points to ensure that it is a physical effect, as opposed to incorrect processing of those data sets. The hypothesised cause of these decreases in efficiency was the presence of resonances in scattering cross sections in the detector case. The cross sections for materials in the detector case are shown in Figure 11. Specifically of note are the first two resonances in the oxygen cross section. When we overlay this cross section with the simulated capture efficiency curve, we find that the dips in the capture efficiency do indeed correspond exactly with these resonances in the oxygen scattering cross section. This can be seen in Figure 12. As a result we attribute these dips to increased scattering on the case, due to this oxygen scattering resonance."
