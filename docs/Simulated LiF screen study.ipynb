    "# Simulated LiF screen study\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of the nFacet 3D system had three LiF:ZnS screens on each PVT cube. However, when developing the mark 2 version of the system, a Monte Carlo study was done to investigate the effect of reducing the amount of LiF:ZnS in the system. One motivation for this is cost; if the amount of LiF:ZnS used per cube can be reduced it can significantly reduce the cost of production for a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional motivation for this study is an asymmetric response caused by the asymmetric placement of the LiF:ZnS screens. For example, consider the X direction where the LiF:ZnS screen is on the negative X face. Neutrons incident from positive X can thermalise in the cube and then capture on the screen on the negative X side of that cube. However, neutrons incident from negative X are more likely to pass through the LiF:ZnS screen and then scatter into the subsequent cube, producing an excess of counts in the subsequent cube and a reduced count in the initial cube. This is illustrated in the figure below."

    "**Figure 1**: illustration of the asymmetric effect introduced by the screen placement. The green bars indicate the placement of the screens, and each cube is labelled with the measured count in that cube. **Top**: a neutron incident from the left passes through the outward facing screen on the first cube, thermalises in the first cube, and then captures on the outward facing screen in the second cube, producing an excess of counts in the second cube. **Bottom**: a neutron incident from the right thermalises in the first cube and captures in that same cube. As a result, we can see that we will obtain a different distribution of counts depending on the incident direction of neutrons and on the orientation of the detector. "

    "Effective dose is measured by first measuring the fluence of a radiation field, and then converting it to an effective dose based on the incident direction of the field via a set of dose conversion coefficients published by the International Comission for Radiation Protection (IRCP) [1]. These coefficients are calculated using an adult male and female reference phantom based off of computerised tomopgraphy data of real people. The 6 geometries considered by the ICRP are as follows: antero-posterior (AP), postero-anterior (PA), right lateral (RLAT), left lateral (LLAT), rotational (ROT), and isotropic (ISO). For each geometry the dose to each organ of the voxelised phantoms is computed and summed for a known fluence, and the dose conversion coefficient for that geometry is calculated as the total dose divided by the known fluence. The AP, PA, RLAT and LLAT geometries consider a radiation field incident from the front, back, left side and right side respectively, whilst the ROT geometry considers a source that rotates around the phantom at a constant rate and the ISO geometry considers an isotropic exposure of the phantom to the radiation field [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these geometries apart from the ISO geometry consider radiation incident in a direction orthogonal to the long axis of the phantom, such that the direction of incidence is in the x-y plane. This motivates placing the single screen on either the top or bottom of the cube, as the effective dose coefficients are predominantly dependent on directions in the x-y plane and thus asymmetry perpendicular to the x-y plane has a lesser effect on the dose measurement. Additionally, the majority of real radiation fields will predominantly be in the x-y plane."

    "#### Goals of the study\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aimed to assess to what degree the amount of LiF:ZnS used per cube could be reduced, and what effect this would have both on the efficiency of the system and on the asymmetry observed in the 3 screens scenario. For each screen placement scheme, the detector was simulated at a distance of 1.5 m from the source in the NPL low-scatter facility geometry as described in **SECTION ABOUT SIMULATION-REAL COMPARISON**, with the generated neutrons incident on the positive y face of the detector. 4 different sources were simulated: monoenergetics at 100 keV, 500 keV and 1.2 MeV, and a $^{252}$Cf source. For each of these sources, the efficiency for each screen placement scheme was calculated as the ratio of the number of neutrons that capture on the LiF:ZnS screens to the total number of neutrons that enter the detector. The calculated efficiencies for the scheme with 3 5 cm by 5cm screens, 1 5cm by 5cm screen, and 1 2.5cm by 2.5cm screen are denoted as $\\varepsilon_3$, $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_1^s$ respectively. These efficiences for each source are given in the table below, as well as the ratio of $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_1^s$ to $\\varepsilon_3$.\n",

For the X direction, this is an increase in the X = 0 plane and a decrease in the X = 3 plane relative to the 3 screen case, whereas for the Y direction this is an increase in Y = 3 and a decrease in X = 0, as in the 3 screen case the screens are on the negative X and the positive Y faces respectively.\n",
