    "# Comparisons between real and simulated data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess the efficiency of the detector, a number of monoenergetic sources were simulated in a no scattering environment in order to calculate a simulated efficiency of capture on $^{6}$Li:ZnS. This data was then compared with real data taken at NPL, with known incident fluence, to ensure that the simulated efficiency is consistent with a real efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially there was a discrepancy between the simulated efficiency and the real efficiency that was inconsistent between the 144 keV and 1.2 MeV measurements at NPL; the real efficiency at 144 keV was ~10% less than the simulated efficiency at the same energy, whereas the 1.2 MeV real efficiency was consistent with the simulated efficiency at that energy within 1$\\sigma$. This can be seen in Figure 1, below."
