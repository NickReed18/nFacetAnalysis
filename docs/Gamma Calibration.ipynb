    "This shows the Compton energy distribution from the Co$^{60}$ source incident in the detector, which comprises of Compton scattering from the two photopeaks of the source. However, peak broadening effects in the detector distort these distributions, resulting in the shape seen in this plot. For this analysis, we focus on the distribution from the first photopeak of Co$^{60}$ at 1173.2 keV, with a Compton edge energy of 963.3 keV. The broadening effects give rise to a non-trivial distribution, but here it is approximated by a half-Gaussian function from the peak of the distribution onwards. The ADC value of this Compton edge can be extracted from the value of ADC at the 1$\\sigma$ width of the distribution. By fitting a half-Gaussian distribution to each channel, this value can be extracted from each channel.\n",

    "The gen_df function of the CouplingAnalysis class performs this fit for each channel and calculates the chi-squared value of each fit, and returns this information in a Pandas DataFrame. If a background dataset is provided, background subtraction is done at this stage as well. "
